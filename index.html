Introduction
Since Jack D. Schwager's publication of Futures: Fundamental Analysis, there haven't been many new works offering systematic research methods for commodities. The past decade has seen dramatic changes in global commodities market. Improved trading liquidity and access to massive data inspire researchers to find new instruments of thinking.

Progress in data science, economics, and management science has deepened our understanding of traders' decision-making process. Economic numbers' impact on commodity prices has been more intricately explained on smaller scales. Therefore, people trust modern data inference tools with the task of prediction. But with no inference rules in mind, it could be data alchemy.

With no surprise, human inference is plagued by numerous biases. They distort evidence intentionally to support personal stances. They predict future events based on similarity among previous evidence. Cognitive weakness has persistently troubled commodities traders too. The author hopes that this work, as a cookbook for commodity traders with detailed cases and concise arguments, can help readers understand fundamental information and form a solid process of reasoning. Only with sound, harmless reasoning can traders attribute trading results to robust fundamental research, apart from variations in their risk preferences or trading skills. Chapter 1 emphasizes integrating commodity fundamental data into usable information for inference, not as easily as you may think. Chapter 2 further discusses the connection between fundamental reasoning and market movement using modern financial and economic theories. 

As data acquisition costs decrease, the focus of many researchers has shifted to using quantitative tools to integrate data. Chapter 3 will introduce statistical models that characterize general markets, providing code examples (in Python) to analyze commodity prices and fundamental data. The author even used AI prompts to simulate trading strategies as analysis benchmarks. Emphasis is placed on cautiously using signals from quantitative analysis, clarifying their roles in the inference process and risk control, and preparing for signal failures.

In enterprises and financial institutions, researchers and traders collaborate, or even are the same individuals. When trading decisions intertwine with information distillation, cognitive biases could multiply. Chapter 4 will help researchers understand how traders apply research implications to their trades, and offer advice on communications within the team. 

Commodities production and pricing are ancient topics. By using latest research toolkits from multiple disciplines to present those age-old topics, the author has discovered many reasoning fallacies and spurious posits as ancient as the business itself. It is hoped that readers, whether involved in commodities production, processing, trading, or investment, will resonate and try to practice as you read. For the author, one motivation for writing this book is to record the dreadful stories he experienced or heard as a multi-market commodity trader, in a calm, reflective way.
